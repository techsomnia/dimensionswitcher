# DimensionSwitcher
A datapack for Minecraft that allows a spectator to switch between the Overworld and the Nether.
## Important Notes
The actual datapack code is in the pack folder that is located in the root. That would be the folder you'll place in your world/datapacks folder.
The pack.zip is the most recent version, but without the naming.
The dimensionswitcher-v{version number}.zip is the actual datapack that is also included in the release.

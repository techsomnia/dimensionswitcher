# DimensionSwitcher
A datapack for Minecraft that allows a spectator to switch between the Overworld and the Nether.
## How to install
1. Download the latest version of the datapack from the Release sections (download the dimensionswitcher-v{version number}.zip, not the source codes)
2. In the zip is a folder named the same as the zip file, that is the folder you should place in /world/datapacks in your Minecraft saves folder or on the server.
3. In your world / on your server, you'll have to run a few commands *once*. You'll need to do this from the console or from the game if you have operator.
The commands:
`/scoreboard objectives add tpnether trigger`
`/scoreboard objectives add tpoverworld trigger`
`/scoreboard players enable @a tpnether`
`/scoreboard players enable @a tpoverworld`
## Important Notes
* For using this datapack, we would recommend using the Latest Release and not the Pre-releases!
* The tutorial above is for the most recent version!
* The actual datapack code is in the pack folder that is located in the root. That would be the folder you'll place in your world/datapacks folder.
* The pack.zip is the most recent version, but without the naming.
* The dimensionswitcher-v{version number}.zip is the actual datapack that is also included in the release.
